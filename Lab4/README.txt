Lab 4 DiceNo Dice
1. For a while the css scripts were not working. Then all of a sudden they were working.  I think it was because one of the css files hadn't been saved.

If the viewer width is greater than 640px "No Dice" is displayed
If the viewer width is 640px or smaller than "Dice" is displayed
My Macbook pro screen and Google Chrome was used to preview the document at greater than 640px.  I used Opera Mobile software on my computer to view the site on a variety of devices with screen widths of less than 640px.

2. There was no collaboration

3. 3 hours were spent on this project
